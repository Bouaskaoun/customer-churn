# Telco Customer Churn

In this project, we will be exploring the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) from Kaggle. This dataset contains information about a telecom company's customers and whether or not they churned (i.e. stopped being a customer).

We will be comparing the performance of 6 different machine learning algorithms in predicting customer churn:

- Dummy Classifier (baseline)
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

Our ultimate goal is to identify the most effective algorithm for predicting customer churn, which will allow the telecom company to take targeted actions to reduce churn and retain valuable customers.

## Conclusion

We tried 6 different machine learning algorithms using default parameters. Finally, we tuned the hyperparameters of the Gradient Boosting Classifier (best performance model) for model optimization, obtaining an accuracy of nearly 80% (close to 6% higher than the baseline).
